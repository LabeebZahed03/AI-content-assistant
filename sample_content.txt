Wellness is a multifaceted approach to achieving physical, mental, and
emotional health. It requires intentional practices such as mindfulness,
balanced nutrition, and regular exercise. Studies have shown that
individuals who prioritize wellness tend to perform better
professionally, with improved focus, resilience, and satisfaction.
Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see increased
productivity, reduced absenteeism, and a positive workplace culture.
